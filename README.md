# Coin Toss !
The coin toss project is an application that generates a result of either heads or tails when the user clicks on the button whie being hosted on port 8000.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** 
* HTML5
* localHost8000
* Vanilla JavaScript 

The html was built with a button id that'll allow the user to click and display the generated result on which face the coin landed on, whether heads or tails. 
Followed by creating a function to run and call the server to operate in port 8000 while being hosted. 

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that properly using the terminal is important so all files work and host where they are being ported to.
